PAYMENT GATEWAY


     payment gateway is a service that securely processes online payments between buyers and sellers. It acts as a bridge between a customer’s payment method (like a card or digital wallet) and the merchant’s bank. 

How It Works:
Customer Makes a Payment – Enters payment details on a website or app.
Encryption & Authentication – The payment gateway encrypts the details and sends them securely.
Bank Authorization – The customer’s bank verifies the transaction and approves or declines it.
Transaction Completion – If approved, the payment is processed, and the merchant gets the money.


*   Three types of payment gateway:

       
          -> Razorpay payment Gateway
	 
          -> wallet Payment

          -> Gift Card Payment  (LGC)
 


*     Razorpay Payment:


      -> Razorpay is one of the payment solution  that allows business to accept , process and commission disburse payment qith suite.

      -> they take commissions

  Their standard fee structure
   2% + GST for domestic transactions (UPI, cards, net banking, wallets)
   3% + GST for international cards and AMEX transactions



*    Wallet Payment

      -  The Lifafa wallet functions like an E-wallet (electronic wallet).
      -  When making a payment within the platform, users just need to provide their wallet number to complete the transaction.
      -  This means the payment is quick and seamless, as the wallet already holds stored funds.


*   Gift  Card Payment:

     - A Gift Card is a preloaded digital card with a fixed amount of money.
     - The recipient can use this virtual card to purchase products from a specific store.
     - The amount on the card can be used to pay for products without needing a separate payment method.
