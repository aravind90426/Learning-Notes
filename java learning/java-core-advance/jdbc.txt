                          C                           
     frontend


we have 4 diff drivers . 

   1) JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver (Type 1)
   2) Native-API Driver (Type 2)
   3) Network Protocol Driver (Type 3)
   4) Thin Driver (Type 4) â€“ Pure Java Driver

connect java to jdbc  (7 steps)

1)    import the package.       (phone)

              -  java.sql.*              

2)    load & register                                           (sim card & network)

          a) load-                   (com.mysl.driver)    library name = MySQL connectoer

                                                 download it


            b)register          ---class.  forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver)
						
	     ->forName is the method used for load the driver	

            its belong to class				
   



3)    establishing the connection   				(dial the number) and call

                        - Connection interface

4)    creating the statement         (result out or not)

                   three types
                      -> statement                - execute query
                      -> prepared Statement        - predefined query
                     -> Callable Statement         - Pl execution
 

5)    execute the query              speak that

6)    Proccess result                yes or not

7)    close                          end

______________________________________________________________________

1) import   java.sql.*;
        
    main()
{

  2)  class.  forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver)

  3)  Connection con  = DriverManager.getConnection( " URL:," UN", "PassWord");
                                      |
                                     static method

  4) StateMent st = con. createStatement;

  5) ResultsSet    = st.executeQuery("Select * from Student");
      \ 
     Interface


  6)     rs.next() - switch to next row and   tell isAvailable or not


       rs.getInt(1)   1- means first colom

    

   while(rs.next())
   {
      sout(rs.get(Int(1) +" " +  rs.get(String(2));
   }



7)  st.close();
    con.close();
