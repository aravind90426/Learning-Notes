Error

can be classified into 3 types.

i) Compile time error.
ii) Run time error
iii) Logical Error    worng output


Excepetion means it is called as  run time error

	it is not a compile time and logical  . it can be happened when the program is after executed.


Excepetion handling is a mechanism in java which is used to handle the exception.

1️⃣ try block – Code that may cause an exception.   which can be used for identified our code has any error or not.
2️⃣ catch block – Handles the exception if one occurs.    
3️⃣ finally block – Executes after try-catch, whether an exception occurs or not.
4️⃣ throws keyword – Used in method signatures to indicate that a method can throw an exception.
5️⃣ throw keyword – Used to manually throw an exception.


we can use multiple catch block. but the parent class Excepetion put atthe last

1. Checked Exceptions (Compile-Time Exceptions)
✅ Checked at compile-time → The compiler forces you to handle them using try-catch or throws.
✅ These exceptions occur due to external factors like file handling, database access, or network issues.
✅ They extend the Exception class but NOT RuntimeException.


IOException (File not found, read/write errors)
SQLException (Database access errors)
InterruptedException (Thread interruptions)
ClassNotFoundException (Trying to load a missing class)



✅ Not checked at compile-time → The compiler doesn’t force you to handle them.
✅ These occur due to programming logic errors, such as invalid input or incorrect calculations.
✅ They extend the RuntimeException class.



Feature	Checked Exception	Unchecked Exception
Checked at	Compile-time	Runtime
Extends	Exception (but NOT RuntimeException)	RuntimeException
Compiler Forces Handling?	Yes (try-catch or throws)	No, but handling is recommended
Common Causes	File handling, DB access, missing classes	Logical errors, invalid inputs
Examples	IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException	NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException




throw  keyword is used to throw the exception  
throw new ArithmeticException("Not eligible to vote"); 

✔ throw is used to manually throw exceptions.
✔ It works inside methods or blocks of code.
✔ Should be followed by an instance of an exception (throw new ExceptionType("message")).
