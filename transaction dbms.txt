	save point
            -> it can be used to save the data temporarly

properties of Transaction
-------------------------

	* Atomacity
	* Consitency
	* Isolation
	* Durability


atomacity
---------
    -> all operation of transaction are performed
              or
       no one operation are not performed(completly not touch)

    -> it has two operation
		* abort - if the transaction is partially stopped when the half exectuted is hide

                *commit - the datas are permanently stored in the database.

consiteny
---------
	     check the correctness the data will be before and after transaction (300+400=700 before   send 100 after->  200+500 =700

isolation
---------
   ->  one data va ore time la rendu per use panna mudiyaathu      multiple transaction are interference at a 
    
    -> it can be used for the inconsitency will not come.

DUrability
----------  
     tranction will be fully completed and stored permanently in database.
     -> if the transaction will be failed . the data will be stored consitency


transaction states

1 - active state    
2 - partially commited
3 - committed state
4 - failed state
5 - aborted state


active state
   ->it is the first state. the transaction will be start exectuded from it
    -> if it has come failed then go to the failed state.
    -> else it is correct then go to the partially corrected state. 

partially commited
    ->all read and write executed. changes can be stored in local buffer
    ->if the changes are made perfanent on the data base it will be go to commited stated
    ->else it eill be failed then go to the failed state.

commited state 
   all the operation are completely done and stored permanently in database then the data will be come commited state.

failed state 
  the data will be store permanently to database if it has fails then it will be come failed state

aborted state
    -> failed transaction state will be come to the aborted state.
     ->aboreted state transaction la local buffer enna enna change pannucho  that all are roll back so data will be consistence. 


tranction sheduke
  serial Schedule  - one by one process of transaction. it takes more time
  non-serial Schedule -  

recovery technique
-> roll back or undo
-> commit or redo

serializability
   non serial Schedule covert into serial Schedule.

normalization

      database la irukkura data viyum attributes siyum organize panndrathutha normailization
